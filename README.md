The overarching goal of this project is to establish the foundation for designing and coding boards with more advanced stm32f-series microcontrollers. These microcontrollers are arm-based, super common in industry and hobbyist projects, have high clock speeds (>100Mhz), and a ton of features you can't find in the older avr chips. Due to their popularity, there is also a strong community of support surrounding these chips. 

## Development Board
- **Microcontroller**
	- STM32F401RCT6
- **Sensors**
	- IMU--BMI088
	- Magnetometer--LIS3MDLTR
	- Barometer--MS560702BA03-50
- **Non-Volatile Memory**
	- FM25L04B-G
- **Connection**
	- Micro-SD
	- Debugging Port 

## Kicad Parts & Footprints
Currently, most of the parts and footprints are located in a [personal library](https://github.com/wFairmanOlin/kicad_parts). I will transition the necessary files to the olin rocketry library when the project is closer to completion.
